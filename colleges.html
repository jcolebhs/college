                    <h2>Mississippi State</h2>
                    <p>Going to Mississippiin state would be one of my favorite colleges to attend. It has always been my dream college sinc I was a little boy. They have a very good engineering program according to previous research that I have done in past years. The only issue for me to attend would be the out of state tuition. I plan to go where it is free.</p>

                   <h2>Georgia Tech</h2>
                   <p>Georgia Tech would be good to do due to its past history. The only thing I would dislike  is the distance from home. Coming from Memphis that would be a very long distance compared to being with my family my whole life. I would definitely be on my own. The true college experience.</p>

                   <h2>Middle Tenneessee State</h2>
                   <p>MTSU would give the best of both worlds. It isn't far from the school and at the same time it is not at home. I have friends there who want me to go so I would have some type of fall back. The tuition seems as if it would be paid for so I would be more than happy to go there.</p>
